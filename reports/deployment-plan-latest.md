## One-Time Setup

- Run the production bootstrap helper with gh credentials so it can set GitHub Pages source to GitHub Actions.
- For project pages, set repository variable VITE_BASE_PATH to /repository-name/.
- Set Cloudflare collector variables and secrets only when live first-party analytics are needed.
- Optionally attach a custom domain before app-store submission so the privacy URL is stable.

## Commands

- Local verification: npm run autonomous:operate
- Deploy workflow: Run Web PWA Deploy workflow or let it run after Autonomous Daily Studio succeeds.
- Collector workflow: Run Event Collector Deploy after Cloudflare variables and secrets are configured.
